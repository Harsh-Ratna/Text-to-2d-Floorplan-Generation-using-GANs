# Dataset Description
The Tell2Design dataset, also known as T2D, is a novel resource specifically created for the task of generating floor plans from natural language descriptions. This dataset includes over 80,000 real floor plan designs from residential buildings, each associated with a set of natural language instructions that describe the intrinsic components of every room in the plan. These instructions detail the semantics, geometry, and topology of the floor plans, providing a comprehensive language-based description of each design.

An interesting aspect of the dataset's creation involved collecting language instructions from both human annotators and artificial sources. Human instructions were gathered via crowd-sourced platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where participants were asked to write detailed descriptions based on given floor plan images. These instructions reflect diverse linguistic expressions and are intended to be as informative as possible to guide the generation of accurate floor plans
